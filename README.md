### Course Content

The easiest way to download and update the course content is to use [Git](https://git-scm.com), a language used for version control relative to this site, GitHub. Git are a series of commands run in the terminal. 

Many MAC computers will already have git installed. To check for installation, open terminal and type `git`, which will return git documentation, if correctly installed. Further guides on installation of Git can be found [here](http://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup00.html). Alternatively, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and run `brew install git`. 

Once installed, Git can be used to quickly download the course content. Run the following command in terminal to download:

`git clone https://github.com/justingrimmer/MathCamp`

Once run, your content will download to your computer. To update the content with any new labs and homeworks, simply navigate to the MathCamp folder and `git pull`:

```
cd MathCamp
git pull
```

A more detailed introductory tutorial for using Git can be found [here](http://jmausolf.github.io/code/Intro_Git/).
